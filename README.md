# simple-neovim-start

A simple, clean, and extendable starting framework for Neovim :)

### Installing Neovim

You can install Neovim using brew (recommended)
```
brew install neovim
```

### Where to place the files in this repo

Make sure to create a folder called `.config/` in your home `~/` directory if it isn't there already. Once you have that, clone the repo anywhere and copy over **only** the `nvim/` folder into `.config/`.
